# Superpush

Superpush is simple bash script to help you push your code to a remote repository faster by automating the process of adding, committing and pushing your code.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/EdgarModesto23/super-push.git
cd super-push
chmod u+x superpush.sh

```

## Usage

You may want to alias the script to make it easier to use. You can do this by adding the following line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file:

```bash

alias superpush="path/to/superpush.sh"

```

Then you can use the script like this:

```bash

superpush <repository> <branch> <commit message>
superpush --help

```
